<div class="notice notice-warning inline"><p>Smart Match players work by reading the contents of your page to select videos for your playlist. This feature requires public content so will only function on the front-end of your website. After publishing the Smart Match player on a page, refresh that page to activate the Smart Match functionality. The menu icon in the top right hand corner of the player will turn from white to green after Smart Match has successfully read your page.</p></div>
